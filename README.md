# Enigma â€“ Data Validation

This solution enables User A to upload a small dataset (email, phone number), 
and also enables a second user to submit their own dataset (with the same fields).

Then, the secret contract compares the two data sets.
If they are equivalent, the secret contract sends an encrypted affirmation of this to User B,
who has now verified their data set against user A.

If they are not equivalent, the user receives a false response.
